# Todo

## Frontend
* [] Header changing color per-zone
* [] Make sure 8 stats fit into armor
* [] Implement "combat timer" element which appears during combat (either in the dead space in the "enemy encounter" tab or rolling on the header)
* [] Create combat stats elements and content to display over dead enemy at the end of combat

## Backend

### New stuff
* [] Start working on player level up system
* [] Add support for multiple enemies
* [] Add rarity to shop items
* [] Get all the characters functioning

### Fixes
* [] Add delay before battle
* [] Update combat systems so they don't use modulo

### Refactoring
* [] Update README.md with info on all backend systems
* [] Get rid of of global variables outside of game?
* [] Refactor game.js? (will likely require a full transition to an object oriented framework to significantly improve)



# Ideas
* I think it would be interesting to have a blurred image per-zone in the background with the color mixed it it. Could see it going either way, but I think it might look nice and add a nice effect.

* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
* Visual indicator for when player or enemy dodges
