# Todo

## Frontend
* [] Header changing color per-zone
* [] Make sure 8 stats fit into armor
* [] Implement "combat timer" element which appears during combat (either in the dead space in the "enemy encounter" tab or rolling on the header)
* [] Create combat stats elements and content to display over dead enemy at the end of combat
* [] Add spots to send usable can't be used/not enough gold to purchase info

*[] function to add translucent floating info boxes by hover


## Backend

### New stuff
* [] Implement magic system and add corresponding shop items into pool
* [] Start working on player level up system
* [] Create shop items for forest zone
* [] Add rarity to shop items

### Fixes
* [] Add 'you died' indicator in g.player.death()
* [] Add feedback when useable can't be used/item can't be purchased

### Refactoring
* [] Update README.md with info on all backend systems
* [x] Refactor combat.js
* [] Refactor path.js
* [] Get rid of of global variables
* [] Refactor game.js? (will likely require a full transition to an object oriented framework to significantly improve)



# Ideas
* I think it would be interesting to have a blurred image per-zone in the background with the color mixed it it. Could see it going either way, but I think it might look nice and add a nice effect.

* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
* Visual indicator for when player or enemy dodges
*
