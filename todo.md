# Ideas
* I think it would be interesting to have a blurred image per-zone in the background with the color mixed it it. Could see it going either way, but I think it might look nice and add a nice effect.

* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
* Visual indicator for when player or enemy dodges
