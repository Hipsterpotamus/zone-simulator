# Todo

## Frontend:
* [] Selectable player classes
* [] Header changing color per-zone
* [] Make sure 8 stats fit into armor
* [] Implement "combat timer" element which appears during combat (either in the dead space in the "enemy encounter" tab or rolling on the header)
* [] Create combat stats elements and content to display over dead enemy at the end of combat
* [x] Disable Next Button after clicking to prevent double click during animation
* [x] Update event display- change event.js to not all send into one div

idk what else, I'm sure you have a list

## Backend
* [] Add feedback when useable can't be used/item can't be purchased
* [x] Change "Enemy Encounter" to "Defeated Enemy" or "Success" or something after winning a battle
* [] Allow player to move to a new zone after completing their current one
* [] Implement magic system and add corresponding shop items into pool
* [] Start working on player level up system
* [] Create shop items for forest zone
* [] Make player classes work with frontend
* [x] Refactor shopitem.js/shopitemlist.js
* [x] Refactor Items
* [] Refactor combat.js
* [] Refactor path.js
* [] Get rid of of global variables
* [] Refactor game.js? (will likely require a full transition to an object oriented framework to significantly improve)



# Ideas
* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
* Visual indicator for when player or enemy dodges
*
