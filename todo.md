# Todo

## Frontend:
* [] Selectable player classes
* [] Header changing color per-zone
* [] Make sure 8 stats fit into armor
* [x] Disable Next Button after clicking to prevent double click during animation
* [x] Update event display- change event.js to not all send into one div

idk what else, I'm sure you have a list

## Backend
* [x] Change "Enemy Encounter" to "Defeated Enemy" or "Success" or something after winning a battle
* [] Make player classes work with frontend
* [] Refactor shopitem.js/shopitemlist.js
* [] Refactor Items
* [] Refactor combat.js
* [] Refactor path.js
* [] Get rid of of global variables
* [] Refactor game.js? (will likely require a full transition to an object oriented framework to significantly improve)



# Ideas
* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
