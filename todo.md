# Todo

## Frontend:
* [] Selectable player classes
* [] Header changing color per-zone
* [] Make sure 8 stats fit into armor

idk what else, I'm sure you have a list

## Backend
* [] Make player classes work with frontend
* [] Refactor shopitem.js/shopitemlist.js
* [] Refactor Items
* [] Refactor combat.js
* [] Refactor path.js
* [] Get rid of of global variables
* [] Refactor game.js? (will likely require a full transition to an object oriented framework to significantly improve)


# Ideas
* Flash a color on the enemy/player when they take damage
